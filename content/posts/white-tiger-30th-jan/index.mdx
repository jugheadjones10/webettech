Have decided to go with the open source forum software [Flarum](https://flarum.org/)
for the web app. It has beautiful UI and is perfect for the job, but there's 
a slight problem - it's built on PHP. Time to understand this giant of
web development. 

[Here's](http://www.hackingwithphp.com/2/2/5/competing-languages) a good
overview of web technologies.
