The point of this "manifesto" is to share some subtle insights and
possibly confusing gotchas about Java generics. It is **not** an overview
of general syntax and basic rules. 

## 1. PECS
The PECS principle, which stands for Producer-Extends-Consumer-Super,
is a guideline to follow when using bounded wildcards.

Consider the classes `Vehicle`, `Car`, `Bus`, and `Roomba`, where `Car` and `Bus`
extends `Vehicle` and `Roomba` extends `Car`.

```java
List<? extends Vehicle> garage = new ArrayList<>();
garage.add(new Vehicle());  // compilation error
garage.add(new Car());      // compilation error
garage.add(new Bus());      // compilation error
garage.add(new Roomba());   // compilation error
```

The errors above seem at first to be uncalled for -
`garage` is a List of "any objects that extend Vehicle" (including
Vehicle itself), so it should be able to accept our Car, Bus,
and Vehicle objects.

What we're missing here is that `List<? extends Vehicle>`
doesn't actually mean a list that can contain any child objects of Vehicle.
`List<? extends Vehicle>` is in fact saying that it is a 
"list parameterized to one concrete class that extends Vehicle".

So `List<? extends Vehicle>` is one of `List<Car>`, `List<Truck>`, or `List<Roombar>`,
but the compiler does not know which. And because the compiler does not know which,
it does not allow the addition of, say, a Vehicle to `List<? extends Vehicle>` - what if the 
unknown identity of `List<? extends Vehicle>` is `List<Car>`? It wouldn't make
sense to add a Vehicle to a list of Cars. The same goes for adding a Car or Bus or Roomba
to `List<? extends Vehicle>`.

What if instead of trying to add to garage, we only want to get from it?
```java
List<Vehicle> vehicles = new ArrayList<>(new Car(), new Bus());
List<? extends Vehicle> garage = vehicles;

Vehicle vehicleOne = garage.get(0);
Vehicle vehicleTwo = garage.get(1);
```

We find ourselves knowing intuitively what type to declare `vehicleOne` and `vehicleTwo` as.
It is in this sense that people say `garage` is a "producer" of sorts - it produces values,
and we consume from it, but we can never insert values into it.

Applying this pattern into the context of a method would look something like this :

```java
List<Vehicle> factory = new ArrayList<>();
public void addAllToFactory(List<? extends Vehicle> vehicles){
    for(Vehicle oneVehicle : vehicles){
        factory.add(oneVehicle);
    }
}

List<Car> cars = new ArrayList<>();
cars.add(new Car());
addAllToFactory(cars); //works
```

The `cars` that we pass into `addAllToFactory` now takes on the role of a "producer",
yielding the values inside it for the `factory` to "consume".

A similar logic applies for Consumer-Super.

```java
List<? super Car> garage = new ArrayList<>();
garage.add(new Roomba());     //runs
garage.add(new Car());        //runs
garage.add(new Vehicle());    // compilation error
```

The compiler knows that `garage`


















## 1. Type Inference

Unlike in generic class instantiations, we may not always
explicitly pass in type arguments to a generic method.

Remember - generics are not covariant
```java
Box<Object> objectBoc = Box.of("Hey")
String heyo = objectBoc.get()
```
Second line doesn't work

```java
 if(object instanceof Box<?>){     
     The wildcard can be removed
```

The below seems illegal to do:
```java 
Box<String> stringBox = Box.of("string");
Object objectified = stringBox;
Box<Integer> integerBox = (Box<Integer>)objectified;

String stringResult = integerBox.get();
Integer integerResult = integerBox.get();
Object objectResult = integerBox.get();
```

## Explanation of PECS



## Why invariant?
## 1. Why Generics
## 2. Type Erasure









































Before diving into the syntax, a brief aside is warranted - why Generics?
If you're familiar with Java you probably know you can survive without Generics by using the Object class.



Here is a simple generic class :
```java
class Gen<T> {

    T ob; 

    Gen(T o) {
        ob = o;
    }

    T getob() {
        return ob;
    }

}
```

To instantiate this generic class, we do this : 
```java
Gen<String> genString = new Gen<String>("hey");
Gen<String> genString = new Gen<>("hey");
```
Both the first line and the second line work (String is inferred
in the second line).

Now let's say I do the following :
```java
Gen<Number> number = new Gen<Number>(5);
number = new Gen<Integer>(5);
```
This will throw an error. Unlike collections,
generics are type invariant.

EXPLAIN WHY GENERICS ARE INVARIANT HERE 

I can also "bound" the type parameter(s) passed into
a generic class - that is, limit the classes whose identities
T can take on.
```java
class Gen<T extends Number> {

    T ob; 

    Gen(T o) {
        ob = o;
    }

    T getob() {
        return ob;
    }

}
```
Now Gen can only take in type parameters which are
subtypes of Number.

```java
Gen<Integer> integer = new Gen<>(5);
Gen<Object> integer = new Gen<>(5);
```
First line works, second line returns an error.

Now let's look at this new version of Gen.
```java
class Gen<T> {

    T ob; 

    Gen(T o) {
        ob = o;
    }

    T getob() {
        return ob;
    }

    boolean genEquals(Gen<T> otherGen){
		return otherGen.getob() == ob;
	}

}

Gen<Number> numberBox = new Gen<>(5);
Gen<Integer> integerBox = new Gen<>(5);

numberBox.genEquals(integerBox);
```
Will the last line run? No. In my Gen class, 
the equals method accepts an argument of type `Gen<T>`.
The "T" here is substituted with Number when numberBox 
is initialized, so otherGen can only  be of type
`Gen<Number>`.

That's also why the last line returns an error that goes :
>incompatible types: Gen<java.lang.Integer> 
cannot be converted to Gen<java.lang.Number>

One solution is using wildcards :
```java
boolean genEquals(Gen<?> otherGen){
    return otherGen.getob() == ob;
}
```
You can also set upper and lower bounds to the wildcard :
```java
boolean genEquals(Gen<? extends Number> otherGen){
    return otherGen.getob() == ob;
}

boolean genEquals(Gen<? super Number> otherGen){
    return otherGen.getob() == ob;
}
```

Making generic methods :
```java
class Gen<T> {

    T ob; 

    Gen(T o) {
        ob = o;
    }

    T getob() {
        return ob;
    }

    static <U> Gen<U> generateGen(U u){
        return new Gen<>(u);
    }

}
```
The generateGen static method is a generic method.
Type parameters are passed in first before return type is 
specified. We can call the static method quite normally
since U is inferred.
```java
Gen<String> generated = Gen.generateGen("Hey");
```
