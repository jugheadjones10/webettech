Some notes from before the start of Webettech:

The NUS Korea Society forum I was tasked to develop is due in around 3 days. Successfully 
using ReForum to finish this will attest to the glorious power of open source collaboration.

Ran into OAuth. Like way too many things, I've heard of it, but don't exactly know 
what it is and how it works. Look into it.

GZip compression - a method of reducing the file size of any type of media being sent
to and from the server for faster load times. Alligator.io explains how to use the npm
module "compression" to enable your server to gzip responses.

Cookies - about time I learn about them. Fun fact: console.log document.cookie to see
a list of key-value pairs of cookies for that website. Use the cookie-parser npm module
to add the cookies list to req.cookies. A cookie can store a session id to help the server
identify the session. Actual session information is stored server-side.

Use express-sessions to deal with sessions.

Passport.js - bound to be useful in the future, so might as well learn it now.

21st Jan :

After some futile wrangling with the ReForum library in order to get the backend set up, I think I've had it with trying to get an open source
project up and running. I'm going to write my own backend, then use frontend React components from ReForum. I'll use MongoDB with Mongoose,
applying the REST API lessons learnt by making the maps backend for Myanmar.<br/><br/>
The below Node.js middleware is very common:

```noLineNumbers
app.use(express.json())
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))
```
The above middleware is used to parse the content inside the body of the POST or PUT request. From the Express documentation,
express.json() does this :<br/><br/>

>Returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.

>A new body object containing the parsed data is populated on the request object after the middleware (i.e. req.body), or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse, the Content-Type was not matched, or an error occurred.

Payloads attached to POST or PUT requests can hold different kinds of content. Some
examples are Content-Type: application/json, application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and multipart/form-data. 
The first type is a json object, and for the second type the payload might look like this :
foo=bar&name=John. **The above middlewares' job is to parse these different types of data.**

Unicode assigns numbers to all the characters in the world so that computers can speak
in a common language.
