Will be attempting to integrate [ChatSDK](https://chatsdk.co/) into the app for 
the next week or so. It's a pretty big open source project, so contributing to it 
might garner quite some merit.

[This](https://developer.android.com/studio/build) and [this](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies) are explanations of the purposes
of all the weird grade files in a standard Android project.

Successfully imported the relevant ChatSDK modules into the project.
Ran into multiple Gradle errors after importing - might end up just following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqJcPtN18I&list=PLxefhmF0pcPmtdoud8f64EpgapkclCllj&index=1).
YouTube series.

Finally figured out the proper difference between styles and themes and how to properly apply them from [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/themes).

Takeaways from the tutorial so far : for all your complaining about the need
to always write too much boilerplate code, the solution was there all along.
When making a new activity or whatever, look at the options in the
dropdown list - some will help you generate your Activity java file with
all the Override methods and also an xml file that matches your activity name.

Also, in xml, android:inputType="textEmailAddress" is important. The user's keyboard
will show his common emails when he starts typing in that EditText.

Use "ProgressDialog" to programmatically create loading logic. 

Tutorial showed me how to disable the back button when going
back in undesirable, an example being when the user has logged in and shouldn't
be able to press back to go to the login page :

```java
private void SendUserToMainActivity() {
  Intent mainIntent = new Intent(RegisterActivity.this, MainActivity.class);
  mainIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK);
  startActivity(mainIntent);
  finish();
}
```

[This](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack) is the
wonderful Android explanation of tasks and back stacks.

New idea for code organization - for every activity or fragment,
in the onCreate or onCreateView method, call a series of methods,
and standardize the name of these methods across the app. Keep the
sequence the same too. For example - setUpRecyclerView(), setUpViewModel(), etc.
Standardize, standardize, standardize.

Curious phenomenon - when I use the version of RecyclerView adapter
that includes the DiffUtil "setList" method, screen updates come
painfully slowly. Only by using the OG adapter pattern
could I make chat messages appear immediately on the screen.

What God, is the difference between layout_gravity and gravity?

the answer.
