Will be attempting to integrate [ChatSDK](https://chatsdk.co/) into the app for 
the next week or so. It's a pretty big open source project, so contributing to it 
might garner quite some merit.

[This](https://developer.android.com/studio/build) and [this](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies) are explanations of the purposes
of all the weird grade files in a standard Android project.

Successfully imported the relevant ChatSDK modules into the project.
Ran into multiple Gradle errors after importing - might end up just following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqJcPtN18I&list=PLxefhmF0pcPmtdoud8f64EpgapkclCllj&index=1).
YouTube series.

Finally figured out the proper difference between styles and themes and how to properly apply them from [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/themes).
