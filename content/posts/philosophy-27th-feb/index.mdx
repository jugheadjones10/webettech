There is a difference between the "concept" of justice, and difference "conceptions"
of justice. It is agreed upon by all that a just society assigns basic
rights to everyone in that society and that principles are needed
for determining how to fairly distribute the "benefits and burdens of 
social cooperation". This is the concept of justice, held by all.
What arises as a source of conflict, however, are the differing "conceptions"
of justice. Different people have different opinions about what 
constitute "basic rights", and about what method of distribution is the
"fairest". 

>That is, they understand the need for, and they are prepared to
affirm, a characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and
duties and for determining what they take to be the proper distribution of
the benefits and burdens of social cooperation.
