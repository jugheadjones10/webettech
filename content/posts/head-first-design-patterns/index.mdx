Flipped through the first few chapter of "Code Complete", but the concrete examples took
way too long to come. So I decided to switch over to "Head First : Design Patterns" first,
just so I can dive straight in and start learning real concrete things.

## Design Principle Number 1 :
"Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the
same."

The biggest example of this I see in my Artwok code is my repository. I abstracted away all
database calls into the FirestoreRepo class, so that even if I decide to change
database from firebase to, say, SQL, all I need to change will be the implementations
in each of the database methods. As long as I make the methods do what they're supposed
to do, I do not need to trawl the rest of the app changing database related code.

>Take the parts that vary and
encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary
without affecting those that donâ€™t.
