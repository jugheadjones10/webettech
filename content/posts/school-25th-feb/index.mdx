## Interface as an Abstraction Barrier

While looking into the Single Responsibility Principle and 
Liskov's Substitution Principle, I came across a 40-page 
summary of software architecture written by some CMU professors.
Since the SOLID principles are a subset of the bigger domain of
software engineering, I thought it wouldn't do any harm to peruse the paper.
Here's a quick summary :

The authors propose a framework with which to view the variety of
software architecture styles out there : all architectures are essentially
a collection of **components**, or nodes, with descriptions of the 
interactions between these components - the **connectors**. These are
combined with a set of **constraints** that limit how the components 
and connectors can be mixed and matched. 

## 1. Pipes and Filters

>In a pipe and filter style each component has a set of inputs and a set of
outputs. A component reads streams of data on its inputs and produces
streams of data on its outputs, delivering a complete instance of the result in a
standard order. This is usually accomplished by applying a local
transformation to the input streams and computing incrementally so output
begins before input is consumed. Hence components are termed “filters”. The
connectors of this style serve as conduits for the streams, transmitting outputs
of one filter to inputs of another. Hence the connectors are termed “pipes”.

Some of the **constraints** on the pipe and filters style :
filters must be independent of one another - they cannot share state, and
each filter, although it can restrict what it receives as input
and what it produces in the output pipe, cannot know which components
are connected to its input and output pipes.

## 2. Data Abstraction and Object-Oriented Organization

This is the architecture most applicable to the CS2030S course.

>Object-oriented systems have many nice properties, most of which are well
known. Because an object hides its representation from its clients, it is possible
to change the implementation without affecting those clients. Additionally,
the bundling of a set of accessing routines with the data they manipulate
allows designers to decompose problems into collections of interacting agents.

>But object-oriented systems also have some disadvantages. The most
significant is that in order for one object to interact with another (via
procedure call) it must know the identity of that other object. This is in
contrast, for example, to pipe and filter systems, where filters do need not
know what other filters are in the system in order to interact with them. The
significance of this is that whenever the identity of an object changes it is
necessary to modify all other objects that explicitly invoke it. In a moduleoriented language this manifests itself as the need to change the “import” list
of every module that uses the changed module. Further there can be sideeffect problems: if A uses object B and C also uses B, then C's effects on B look
like unexpected side effects to A, and vice versa.

## 3. Event-based, Implicit Invocation

>The idea behind implicit invocation is that instead of invoking a
procedure directly, a component can announce (or broadcast) one or more
events. Other components in the system can register an interest in an event by
associating a procedure with the event. When the event is announced the
system itself invokes all of the procedures that have been registered for the
event. Thus an event announcement "implicitly" causes the invocation of
procedures in other modules.

>Architecturally speaking, the components in an implicit invocation style
are modules whose interfaces provide both a collection of procedures (as with
abstract data types) and a set of events. Procedures may be called in the usual
way. But in addition, a component can register some of its procedures with
events of the system. This will cause these procedures to be invoked when
those events are announced at run time. Thus the connectors in an implicit
invocation system include traditional procedure call as well as bindings
between event announcements and procedure calls.

## 4. Repositories

>In a repository style there are two quite distinct kinds of components: a central
data structure represents the current state, and a collection of independent
components operate on the central data store. Interactions between the
repository and its external components can vary significantly between systems.

Here is an example of a "heterogeneous" architecture :

>Another example is an “active database”. This is a repository which
activates external components through implicit invocation. In this
organization external components register interest in portions of the database.
The database automatically invokes the appropriate tools based on this
association. (Blackboards are often constructed this way; knowledge sources are
associated with specific kinds of data, and are activated whenever that kind of
data is modified.)
