Insane, the kind of mistakes I make. FIRESTORE DATABASE CALLS ARE ASYNCHRONOUS.
SUBSEQUENT CODE EXECUTES EVEN THOUGH DB CALL MIGHT NOT HAVE FINISHED.

[Essential firebase tasks API explanation series](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/09/become-a-firebase-taskmaster-part-1.html?utm_campaign=Firebase_culture_education_general_en_09-29-16&utm_source=Firebase&utm_medium=blog)

Big revelation. I had always thought my setListings or setPosts
implementation in all my Adapters had been impeccable since I had
copied DiffUtil code :

```java
  public void setListings(final List<Listing> listings) {
        if (this.listingsList == null) {
            this.listingsList = listings;
            notifyItemRangeInserted(0, listings.size());
        } else {
            DiffUtil.DiffResult result = DiffUtil.calculateDiff(new DiffUtil.Callback() {
                @Override
                public int getOldListSize() {
                    return ListingsAdapter.this.listingsList.size();
                }

                @Override
                public int getNewListSize() {
                    return listings.size();
                }

                @Override
                public boolean areItemsTheSame(int oldItemPosition, int newItemPosition) {
                    return ListingsAdapter.this.listingsList.get(oldItemPosition).getPostid().equals(
                            listings.get(newItemPosition).getPostid());
                }

                @Override
                public boolean areContentsTheSame(int oldItemPosition, int newItemPosition) {
                    return ListingsAdapter.this.listingsList.get(oldItemPosition).getPostid().equals(
                            listings.get(newItemPosition).getPostid());
                }
            });
            this.listingsList = listings;
            result.dispatchUpdatesTo(this);
        }
    }
```

But when an empty list was passed into setListings,
nothing happened on screen; the recycler view items were still there.
Does result.dispatchUpdatesTo(this) not work if the update is that the
new listings is empty? I had to add notifyDataSetChanged() in order to 
make the items disappear from the screen, which kind of defeats the whole
purpose of DiffUtil. 

```java     
this.listingsList = listings;
notifyDataSetChanged();
result.dispatchUpdatesTo(this);
```

This causes the whole recycler view to refresh every time I favorite 
or un-favorite a listing; there's got to be a way around this. 

An even worse finding : removing one item from a populated list
messes up the order of the recycler view items and results in
incomprehensible behaviour.

[Good explanation of Diff Util](https://therubberduckdev.wordpress.com/2017/11/09/handle-data-change-in-recyclerview-using-diffutil/)

1st Feb 2020 :
I was under the severely misguided impression that the doesItContain variable below
would return true.

```java
public class HelloWorld
{
  // arguments are passed using the text field below this editor
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    
    List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();

    User singleUser = 
    users.add(new User("1", "234", "user"));
    users.add(new User("2341", "efef", "sef"));
    users.add(new User("99", "99", "9"));

    Boolean doesItContain = users.contains(new User("1", "234", "user"));


    System.out.print(doesItContain);
  }
}
```

Remember - once you make a new class, it is different from another class of the
same type even if all the inside fields are the same.

The remedy :

```java
public class HelloWorld
{
  // arguments are passed using the text field below this editor
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    
    
    List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();

    User singleUser = new User("1", "234", "user");
    users.add(singleUser);
    users.add(new User("2341", "efef", "sef"));
    users.add(new User("99", "99", "9"));

    Boolean doesItContain = users.contains(singleUser);


    System.out.print(doesItContain);
  }
}
```

Easy concepts, but you clearly haven't internalized them yet.
Update after a few hours : O God. I made the exact same mistake, except with ArrayLists.
If I initialize two ArrayLists, even if their contents are different, == will return false.

Use list1.equals(list2) instead. This will compare contents only.

Write an article on how context works, please.

Insane hack around the problem of the sticky header above the main page vertical 
recycler view.
