Some notes from before the start of Webettech:

Current problem: am trying to pass user id of a user to a view model,
 which will in turn pass the user id to a repository method calling 
 Firestore for the list of posts by that user. 

The problem was easily solved when the user id was simply the current user's 
: nothing had to be passed to the view model, since it could 
just call getCurrentUser.getUid() using FirebaseAuth.

I read somewhere that the view model should be completely 
independent from the view, meaning I shouldn't pass any data to 
it. The common paradigm is that the view "subscribes" to the view 
model for live data updates, and never the other way around. But 
what happens if the nature of the subscription depends on data from the view? 

From the Android documentation : 

>Caution: A ViewModel must never reference a view, Lifecycle, 
>or any class that may hold a reference to the activity context.

Update: kind of solved it? Unsure if this is correct. Passed in user id when calling the retrieval method in the view model: 
 
Look more into how view model works.
Study how factories work.<br/><br/>

Reminder on how to solve a recurring error : 
when using data binding, make sure all your package names
or lowercase. Compiler (?) might mistake a camel-cased package
name as a class.<br/><br/>

What exactly does setSupportActionBar do for toolbars? As 
gleaned from generous Stack Overflow answers :

>A Toolbar is a generalization of action bars for use 
within application layouts. While an action bar is 
traditionally part of an Activity's opaque window decor 
controlled by the framework, a Toolbar may be placed
at any arbitrary level of nesting within a view hierarchy. 
An application may choose to designate a Toolbar as the 
action bar for an Activity using the setActionBar() method.

Sometimes I find myself writing a lot of brainless boilerplate code when 
setting up new fragments that are relatively simple. Is there a tool for 
generating Android boilerplate on the go?<br/><br/>

Discovered a great hack on Stack Overflow. I’ve always been confused about how to set the gravity inside a horizontal linear layout such that there’s one item gravitated to the extreme left and another to the extreme right. Here, ladies and gents, is the genius solution behind how:
Gravity left, right doesn't work when the orientation of the LinearLayout is set to horizontal (as the views are placed along the X axis). One way to do what you want is to insert an empty View between the two LinearLayouts to create a space between them:

```noLineNumbers
<View android:layout_width="0dp"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:layout_weight="1" />
```

Found a really hacky solution to the position of the indicator being left instead of on the right (in ExpandableListView). Add this to ExpandableListView:
android:layoutDirection="rtl"
And add this to the xml for list group items:

android:gravity="left" //to adjust the text to align to the left again

android:layoutDirection="ltr"  //OR this line, based on your layout

Is it really possible that only Java hacks and weird xml workarounds
like the above can solve my problem? Surely it can’t be that the
whole online community is collectively unaware of a solution in
the docs. A shortcoming from Google’s Android team maybe?<br/><br/>

One problem I consistently face is the following :

```java {3,12}
    public boolean isEmailDuplicate(String email){

        Boolean isEmailDuplicate;

        db.collection("Users")
                .whereEqualTo("email", email)
                .get()
                .addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<QuerySnapshot>() {
                    @Override
                    public void onSuccess(QuerySnapshot queryDocumentSnapshots) {
                        if(queryDocumentSnapshots == null){
                           isEmailDuplicate = true;
                        }
                    }
                });
    }
```

I want to return a boolean using results from the database call. 
But when I try to use a value holder such as isEmailDuplicate,
I get this error :

>Variable "isEmailDuplicate" is accessed from inner class, needs to be 
final or effectively final.

As explained in [this](https://blog.brendanlacanette.com/2015/08/variable-is-accessed-within-inner-class.html)
great blog, a local variable modified in the inner class is only modified in the
inner class; the change does not persist in the outer class. The final keyword
was made compulsory just to remind developers of this fact - that no matter
what they do to the variable in the inner class, outside, the variable is 
unchanged.
 
>The inner class is a closure. It copies the variable from it's enclosing scope to a new variable, and brings just that copy inside the inner class. 
Anything it does to that copy is independent from the variable in the
enclosing scope. So if the variable changes in the inner class, and
then it is used later in the enclosing scope, the changes made independent
the inner class did not persist in the enclosing scope.

The solution? Declare an instance variable **outside** the isEmailDuplicate method.

Update : the above method does not work. Since the instance variable is given a 
value in an asynchronous database call, calls to the isEmailDuplicate immediately returns
the instance variable instead of waiting for the database call to update its value.
Only when the method is called a second time a while later is the correct value returned,
since the database call was completed and subsequently set the value of isEmailDuplicate.
I will need to implement a callback mechanism to get this working.<br/><br/>

There's a difference between boolean and Boolean. boolean is a primitive type 
while Boolean is an object to which multiple methods are attached.<br/><br/>

What's the difference between getActivity() and getContext()?
