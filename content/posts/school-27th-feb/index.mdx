Consider the following classes:

```java
class FastFood{

}

class Burger extends FastFood {

}

class CheeseBurger extends Burger{

}
```

Let's say we have a method that accepts an array of burgers:

```java
void foo(Burger[] burgers){

}

Burger[] burgers = new Burger[1];
CheeseBurger[] cheeseBurgers = new CheeseBurger[1];
```

Both burgers and cheeseBurgers can be passed into foo - this makes 
java arrays what is called "co-variant". 

But what happens when I try to store a Burger object in the cheeseBurgers
array? I get an error. It only works the other way round - storing
a CheeseBurger in the burgers array.

How about for generic classes?

```java
class Box<T> {

    private final T t;

    private Box(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    T get() {
        return t;
    }

    static <T> Box<T> of(T t) {
        return new Box<>(t);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "[" + t + "]";
    }
}
```

Let's do the same thing we did with the burger and cheese burger arrays:

```java
void foo(Box<Burger> box){

}

Box<Burger> burgerBox = Box.of(new Burger());
Box<CheeseBurger> cheeseBurgerBox = Box.of(new CheeseBurger());
```

Like the burgers and cheeseBurgers arrays, will we be able to
pass in both burgerBox and cheeseBurgerBox to foo?

No, it turns out. We can 
only pass in the burgerBox.
That's because Java generics are **invariant**.
One way around this is by using something called **wildcards**.

```java
void foo(Box<? extends Burger> box){

}

foo(burgerBox);
foo(cheeseBurgerBox);
```

Now, the last two lines will not return an error. The question mark
and extends keyword tells Java to accept any generic whose type extends
that of Burger (and of course Burger itself).

The upper-bounded wildcard makes generics **co-variant**.

Here's a possible gotcha:

```java
Burger getBurger(Box<? extends Burger> box) { 
    return box.get(); 
}

CheeseBurger cheeseBurger = getBurger(Box.of(new CheeseBurger()));
```

Is the last statement legal? No. The return type of 
getBurger is Burger, so the run-time type of the cheeseburger in the box
will be cast to Burger when being returned. 

Since an upper-bounded wildcard exists, there of course exists
the lower-bounded wildcard.

Consider this modified box:

```java
class Box<T> {

    private final T t;

    private Box(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    T get() {
        return t;
    }


    private boolean isEmpty() {
        return this.t == null;
    }

    static <T> Box<T> empty() {
        return new Box<>(null);
    }

    Box<T> add(T t) {
        return isEmpty() ? new Box<>(t) : this;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "[" + (isEmpty() ? "empty" : t) + "]";
    }
}

Box<Burger> putBurger(Box<Burger> box) {
    return box.add(new Burger());
}

Box<Burger> emptyBox = Box.empty();
Box<Burger> fullBox = putBurger(emptyBox);

Box<FastFood> emptyBox = Box.empty();
Box<FastFood> fullBox = putBurger(emptyBox);


```
