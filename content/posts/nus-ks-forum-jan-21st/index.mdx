Some notes from before the start of Webettech:

The NUS Korea Society forum I was tasked to develop is due in around 3 days. Successfully using ReForum to finish this will attest to the glorious power of open source collaboration.

Ran into OAuth. Like way too many things, I've heard of it, but don't exactly know what it is and how it works. Look into it.

GZip compression - a method of reducing the file size of any type of media being sent to and from the server for faster load times. Alligator.io explains how to use the npm module "compression" to enable your server to gzip responses.

Cookies - about time I learn about them. Fun fact: console.log document.cookie to see a list of key-value pairs of cookies for that website. Use the cookie-parser npm module to add the cookies list to req.cookies. A cookie can store a session id to help the server identify the session. Actual session information is stored server-side.

Use express-sessions to deal with sessions.

Passport.js - bound to be useful in the future, so might as well learn it now.
