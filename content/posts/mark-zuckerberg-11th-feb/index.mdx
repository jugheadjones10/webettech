Finally we start. Will try and get my head around [Planka](https://planka.app/),
the beautiful Trello clone, before integrating it with Myanmar
maps and adding my own features to end up with a custom-made
Myanmar app that I'd been talking about for literally years.

[Here's] a guide through the heart-stoppingly complex and
confusing and downright anti-user process of setting up a 
React project with Webpack and Babel. I hate them, I really do.
I hate them so much. 

Will be following [this](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/) tutorial to 
get my head around redux.

Supposedly one of the most important rules in Redux is that state should be immutable.

Actions are javascript objects with a type and a payload. The creation of these
objects are usually "abstracted away" into functions. For example, a function called 
updateProject takes in a payload and returns the action object.

There are a few key methods you can call on Redux's store object. You can
getState(), dispatch() an action, or subscribe() to execute a callback whenever
an action is dispatched.

In react-redux, there's something called connect, which can either connect
the component to data from the Redux state or provide the component with
the dispatch method so it can dispatch actions. 

Middleware can intercept actions before they reach the reducer. 

A very commonly used module for redux users is something called ["redux-thunk"](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk).
Basically what it does it to check actions to see if they are functions - usually they
are objects with the type and payload properties, but if I want to make an asynchronous
call, I can make an action creator like so :

```javascript
function logOutUser() {
  return function(dispatch, getState) {
    return axios.post('/logout').then(function() {
      // pretend we declared an action creator
      // called 'userLoggedOut', and now we can dispatch it
      dispatch(userLoggedOut());
    });
  };
}
```

If the actions is indeed a function, redux thunk passes in dispatch and getState
and calls it. [Here's](https://daveceddia.com/what-is-a-thunk/) a solid explanation.

So i guess you could say redux thunks are "fake" actions.
Real actions get passed into dispatch, but thunks simply get called,
with a "real" action usually getting dispatched inside it after an
important async call has completed.

Redux saga works a bit differently - it listens for actions of a specific type, then
dispatches a "real" action after calling an asynchronous function.

Finally learnt about react routing [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-router-v4-complete-guide/).

[Here's](https://dmitripavlutin.com/use-react-memo-wisely/) a cool application of a concept learnt in
CS1101S, memoization, to React.

Important note about Redux :
>In Redux, whenever an action is called anywhere in the application, 
all mounted & connected components call their mapStateToProps function. 
This is why Reselect is awesome. It will just return the memoized result 
if nothing has changed.

[Here](https://blog.logrocket.com/a-guide-to-react-refs/) is a guide to the elusive ref
keyword in React.

And [this](https://medium.com/@rossbulat/react-using-refs-with-the-useref-hook-884ed25b5c29) here demystifies the useRef() 
React hook.

You can enable "strict" mode in React to receive updates about "structuring" problems in your
code.

[This](https://simonsmith.io/destructuring-objects-as-function-parameters-in-es6) cleared up
some misunderstandings I held before about object destructuring in Javascript.

[This](https://medium.com/@jan.hesters/usecallback-vs-usememo-c23ad1dc60) explains the
subtle difference between useCallback and useMemo in React.

[Here](https://daveceddia.com/useeffect-hook-examples/) is the best example of the 
useEffect React hook. Passing in an empty array as the second argument isn't meaningless after all.

Functions like put() and call() in redux-saga actually return plain old Javascript objects.

Remember to try using ESLint on your code. Apparently it points out a lot of things you can
improve on. 

This project is kind of insane. Every single module has multiple dependencies on a dozen
other modules, and those each have another dozen dependencies, and so on. I end
up at the bottom of a long and winding rabbit hole with no clear end in sight.

I probably should get some A4 paper and start sketching out the flow of the entire app, 
describing what each modules does, and what gets passed on to dependency modules, etc.
