Encountering some confusion regarding the difference between Relative Layout and
Constraint Layout. 

Classname.this is used to refer to the outermost class from an inner class.
For example :

```java
Button button = (Button)findViewById(R.id.ticket_details_sell_ticket);
button.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        // it will be wrong to use only "this", because it would
        // reference the just created OnClickListener object
        Intent login = new Intent(ClassName.this, Login.class);
        startActivityForResult(login, LOGIN_REQUEST);
    }
});
```

Still not very sure about the role of ViewModel. Sometimes seems like an
unnecessary middleman between the view and the repository.

Maybe it's the conversion from live data to usable data. The "observe" part of 
view model allows live data to be "observed" in the view and to be used as 
normal data.

Write an overview of all the different types of data structures in Java :
Arrays, ArrayLists, Lists, etc. The confusion is killing me.

ScrollView can only have one child, usually a linear layout.
